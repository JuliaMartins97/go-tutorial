Go needs to be translated to a lower level language to be executed, run in a compiler 

Command to run: go run -name of the file- this command compile and execute the file 

Command to build: go build -name of the file -- > type the name of the file on the terminal - creates an execuatable file  

Variables and Data types: 
string 
int 
*uint = positive numbers*
float32 float64  
bool 

name2 := "Joe" - this syntaxe  := is going to guess what the type of the variable is  and assign it. It is equal to var name string = "Joe"

Everytime you declared a variable you have to use it otherwise will pop up an error
